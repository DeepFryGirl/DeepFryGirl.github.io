<p> My Learning Style Quiz, shows I have well-rounded abilities! I learn best Kinesthetically, by doing. I also demonstrate the ability to concentrate when listening and absorb information very well in this way, as well as from reading and following clearly written instructions. </p>

<p> People with strong Intrapersonal skills are adept at looking inward, learning independently and through reflection. I’m quintessentially introverted, introspective, and intuitive. I do psychoanalyze myself and seek deeper understanding of all things. </p>

<p> Strong naturalist intelligence shows my sensitivity to, and appreciation for nature. I recharge in nature, am always aware of my surroundings, and have very good built-in safety mechanisms. I am quick to notice natural patterns and pick up on changes around me. </p>

<p> People with Logical Intelligence process information with logic and reason, seeking accuracy and precision in learning and work, with the ability to scrutinize information and data. </p>

<p> Rating high on the Linguistics intelligence shows my love for reading and writing, and good teaching abilities to communicate complex concepts. </p>

<p> Those with strong Musical intelligence are highly auditory. I often use rhythm and music to help memorize concepts - the technique of applying what I call a little “musical ditty” - associating keywords with musical notes, or vice versa, to help me memorize entire speeches or play musical compositions (and still remember them years later!). </P>

<p> The characteristics of high visual intelligence support my ability to picture and visualize concepts quite vividly, I am good at puzzles, love to draw and paint, and have an eye for artistic design. I paint and sculpt in my spare time. </p>

<p> I rate considerably above average in all areas except Interpersonal skills where I am considerably below average. Intrapersonal is between me and myself, Interpersonal is between two or more people. People with high Interpersonal skills thrive with social interaction and are gifted in making rapport with strangers, that does not describe me very accurately because I generally just don’t bother. Although I’m like a chameleon and could blend in if I wanted, I tend to avoid people, large crowds, and social interaction. I highly value my peace, solitude, and quiet time. </p>
