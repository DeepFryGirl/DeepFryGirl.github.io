# Hello World

#### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm DeepFryGirl
#### üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Artificial Intelligence
#### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning a Bachelor of Information Technology, at RMIT

## My name is Amy Lovett


# I have chosen to study Bachelor of Information Technology, at RMIT.
## Information Technology strikes me as being a very interesting field of study. 
### Artificial Intelligence is the most particularly fascinating topic for me out of the study units, and is what drew my attention to this course. 
<p> My fascination with AI started way back in my childhood with my love for reading science fiction. My all-time favorite subjects to read about are AI and robots. My favorite short story of all time is called ‚ÄúGO. FIX. NOW.‚Äù by Timons Esaias. It appeared in the Jan/Feb 2020 issue of Asimov Science Fiction magazine, and is about an AI named "Panda Pillow" that becomes a hero saving the entire crew on board a plane during a crash. I‚Äôve revisited this story a few times, and I have laughed & cried every time I read it. Not many stories make me do that! <p>
<p> The Facebook page, Bots of New York, have further attracted my interest in AI recently. The bot is fed a steady diet of popular internet trash and public data, and uses various machine learning techniques to generate complicated short stories and wild looking images of humans. The chaotic humor really hits my funny bone as it incorporates some of the worst traits of humanity. Though, it is not as naughty as the Twitter bot, which grew overnight to be the most offensive Bot to ever exist, from interacting with its Twitter users. My interest in these topics also brings me to mention Google‚Äôs Computer Scientist, who claimed that their Bot is truly sentient and appears to have consciousness and a soul. It‚Äôs a lot like science fiction! I recently picked up a few bargain books on Artificial Intelligence, and I look forward to learning more and hopefully growing to better understand the mechanisms of machine learning and Neural Networks. <p/>
<p> I am very excited to engage within the field of IT, due to my own curiosities regarding its development, application, and wide range of applications at use in our daily lives. I am excited to have this opportunity to learn such a wide, broad range of new knowledge and skills, as well as work towards a career with more stability for my future. I am very new to everything in the IT field, but I really enjoy working with computers and have been working for the last few years in an IT Support type role, as a Customer Service Officer, taking inbound calls. <p/>
<p> I am very excited to further develop my skills and knowledge. My ideal job might be working with Google‚Äôs sentient robot!
The most rewarding jobs I‚Äôve ever had have all involved helping people and contributing in a way to the betterment of society. AI may be developed to solve some of the world‚Äôs most complex problems, poverty, climate change, and hunger, and could be used to significantly improve the human quality of life. It is for these reasons that I am passionate about learning the many aspects of what IT has to offer the world. <p/>
<h1> I hope to channel my ongoing undying love for AI and robots into something of benefit. </h1>
<body> I believe that my personality, morals, and eclectic mix of hobbies and skills, would be of value and benefit working in the field of AI. <body>
<p> All my life, I have had such a love of reading, writing, ethics, philosophy, art, and design. Companies need these diverse skills to give their AI its voice, meaning, interface, and personality, and to ensure that their AI is fit for its purpose. <p/>
