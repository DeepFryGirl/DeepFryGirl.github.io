# The most rewarding jobs I’ve ever had have all involved helping people and contributing in a way to the betterment of society.
<p> AI may be developed to solve some of the world’s most complex problems, poverty, climate change, and hunger, and could be used to significantly improve the human quality of life. It is for these reasons that I am passionate about learning the many aspects of what IT has to offer the world. </p>

I believe that my eclectic mix of hobbies, interests, and skills, also my values, would be of great benefit within the world of AI. 

<p> All my life, I have had such a love of reading, writing, ethics, philosophy, art, and design. 
Companies need these diverse skills to give their AI its voice, meaning, morals, interface, and personality, and to ensure that their AI is fit for its purpose. </p>
