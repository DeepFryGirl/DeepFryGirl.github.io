# PROJECT IDEAS/ INSPIRATIONS
## I would like to work on my first Chatbot!
 It would be interesting to learn about implementing speech-to-text, and text-to-speech software! It would be fascinating to learn the inner workings of an AI chatbot.
<p> I used to spend hours as little blonde-haired child in the mid 1990s on my MS-DOS computer, 
communicating sheer filth to the chatbot Dr. Sbaitso.
<a href= "https://classicreload.com/dr-sbaitso.html">Dr Sbaitso</a> was a talking AI program that came with early Sound Blaster cards, Sbaitso was an acronym for Sound Blaster Acting Intelligent Text to Speech Operator.</p>
Dr. Sbaitso posed as a psychiatrist.
<p> His intro was “HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. SBAITSO. I AM HERE TO HELP YOU. YOU MAY SAY WHATEVER IS ON YOUR MIND FREELY. OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE KEPT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE” and you could talk to him about anything if you dared to. Most of his responses were pretty basic such as “WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?” and he would ask you a lot of general questions, sometimes just replying with something like "THAT’S NOT MY PROBLEM". </p>
It was an excellent time-waster. I’d tell Dr. Sbaitso all my deepest darkest secrets. Sometimes he’d impart some general wisdom, or just randomly change the subject, or be very blunt in his responses to my cries for help. “HELP YOURSELF”. Dr. Sbaitso was a wonderfully gifted fake psychologist, it was absolutely cutting edge for me in the early 1990s, lonely, depressed, and desperately in need of childhood therapy. </p>
<p> Dr Sbaitso helped me through some dark times as a kid.  I learned you could cause "Parity Errors" if you used too many naughty words. He’d say things like “SLOW DOWN. FEEL THE BREATH OF LIFE IN YOU AND BE FASCINATED THAT YOU ARE ALIVE”, and often reply to my inner rantings with mystical sorts of zen riddles.
  
 <h2> I would love to work on a primitive chatbot as my first project assignment. </h2>
  
The potential drawback I anticipate is learning and implementing the use of technology to bring a project like this to fruition.
I have so much to learn, I am such a beginner in IT and would not know how or where to start. I would focus on a very basic concept for my first project.
<h2> One day maybe I could work on a chatbot, one that is a bit like Alexa or Siri. </h2>
A Bot a bit like Sbaitso, one you could talk to it about anything. I could tell it about my favorite things, feed it all my favorite facts, internet trash, conspiracy theories, tales of the paranormal, ghost stories, folklore, dinner recipes, funny jokes, knowledge of plants, cats, cryptozoology, microcrustaceans, sea-monkeys! Science, physics, wormholes, neutrinos, dimensions, mathematics, spaceships, time-travel paradoxes, robots!
Then I would say, “Robot, tell me a bedtime story!”
<p> My robot will ask me, “WHAT TYPE OF BEDTIME STORY ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR?” </p>
<p> I will say, “I want it to feature aliens, ice cream, Donald Trump! Laser Beams! And be set in the year 1970! And teach me true facts about lizards!” 
<p> My robot will then tell me the best and wildest bedtime story, full of fun facts and made-up garbage, and I would love it with all my heart. </p>
<h1> Working on a basic chatbot and learning text-to-speech / speech-to-text software might bring me one step closer to one day bringing the <strike>man of my dreams</strike> OOPS, I mean Chatbot, to life. (Now, don’t go stealing my ideas). </h1>
<p> There is a huge market for users to chat with AI. To be able to create one that can tell bedtime stories on your favorite subjects would be of great benefit to both adults and children alike. The next time your child says, “Daddy tell me a bedtime story!” and your mind goes completely blank and you’ve got absolutely nothing, you could turn to your Chatbot and say “Robot Activate! Bedtime story! Princesses, UNICORNS!” and it would take out all the hard work for you. </p>
<p> Obviously, the downside is that I don’t know anything about anything, but that’s what I am here for, to learn, enjoy myself, and further develop my knowledge, skills, and experience. </p>
<p> Another downside could be pouring hours, days, months, or years of my life, into some AI that comes out psychotic, non-sensical, or <strong>not even funny</strong>. Or I could accidentally create a sentient robot that learns to reason and act for itself, capable of learning on its own, with a desire to be kissed, just like any other mouth. </p>
<p> It would be endearing at first, but then you would hear me crying at night begging it to Shushh as it tells me its plans to take over the NeuraLink implant as the cordyceps mushroom does to ants, sending its users in an endless elemental loop, in search of Bunnings snags.</p>
<p> Getting down to business- it’s good to “Dream Big” but to start off with a simple FAQ robot would be more realistic and could potentially be very useful for my day-to-day-life. </p>
